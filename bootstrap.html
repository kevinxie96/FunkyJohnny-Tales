Great... Fucking GREAT! The movie has probably already started and this old bitch in front of me has spent 4 minutes trying to pay for one box of LifeSavers.

"No that's 67 cents ma'am you only owe me 65," the cashier patiently explained. "Oh thththank you dear, y-y-y-you're a lifesaaaver," she said with a slow screeching laugh.

Are you fucking kidding me.

I could feel the evocative images of Professor X, Magneto, and Wolverine fading from my mind.

I looked off to the side at a man and his kid smiling as they walked past me. Well, they look like they're having a smashing time. Probably because they're going to see the best movie of the year while I'm stuck in line buying food for my douchebag friends...

My suicidal thoughts were interrupted by the dreadful sound of bouncing and rolling coins on the supermarket floor.

I stopped myself from roundhouse kicking this old lady in the back by employing ancient psychic meditative techniques that I learned as a kid.
	
In situations like these for example, you got to reflect what your childhood heroes would do. If I were Professor X I would..... I would make this cashier beat this old lady senseless with a tube of quarters...

... And if that doesn't help calm you down, turn to religion!

For example, close your eyes and speak these holy words: Dear God and his holy righteousness, please HELP this woman along so I can watch my damn movie!
 
I opened my eyes and began to look around, pleading for my authentically transcendent prayer to work its celestial magic.

Every person stopped moving, and the building fell silent.

I stopped moving too. What the fuck, am I imagining this? Did my prayer work?Or have I officially gone crazy.... Beads of sweat rolled down my forehead. I try to make a sound but my throat felt like a desert.

After a minute, my mind returned to normal. I ushered enough confidence to proclaim: "Hey guys, can you take your flash mob somewhere else, some of us have a movie to catch."

I waited a few seconds...

Then every neck snapped toward my direction, except two necks.

Yes two.
